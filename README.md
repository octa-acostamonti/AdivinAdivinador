#ADIVINADIVINADOR - Guess the Number Game

Hello! Today I present you a simple "Guess the Number" game using Python. 

The game is in Spanish. It follows this steps:

It begins by welcoming you. 

Then it prints out how the game works. 

Finally the game starts. 


The first step of the game is to select the maxium value for the computer to generate a random number. Next the game starts and you have to place a number and the computer will tell you if the random number is higher, lower or if it is the number your looking for.

To play you only have to have Python installed and press double click on the "adivinadivinador.py" file.

It is the first version of it and I am looking foward on improving it.
